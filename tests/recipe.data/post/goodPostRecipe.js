Combine well using your hands. You can marinate this mixture in the fridge for a few hours if you have time. Cut the Pita Bread: Halve the pita bread to create half-circle pockets.Stuff the Pitas: Place a few tablespoons of the ground beef mixture inside each pita half. Spread it out evenly, ensuring itâ€™s not too thick. The filling should come all the way to the edge for a nice sear when grilled. Optional Stovetop Grilling: Brush the arayes with olive oil on both sides. Sear them on a stovetop grill for a few minutes on each side to get those beautiful grill marks. Flip them onto the exposed meat side for a nice caramelization."}]}]'
